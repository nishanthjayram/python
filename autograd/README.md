# autograd
Implementation of autogradient through the use of expression trees, built from scratch in Python. This code was
developed as part of a course on advanced Python programming at UC Santa Cruz.

The main source code is contained in autograd.py, with an implementation for expression trees that includes arithmetic
operators and differentiation. Components are tested on a given set of points in test.py, which also uses pyplot
to print the resulting fitted curve.
